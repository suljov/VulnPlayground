The old terminal flickers. A prompt appears.  
A voice encoded in bytes asks for *the word*.

Those who answer wrong are erased.  
Those who answer right? Nobody remembers them anymore.

They say the answer is hidden in the code â€” buried, scrambled, waiting.  
Only those who see the unseen may pass.

This box is completed when you speak the word that opens the path.

Flag structure is: FLAG{the_word}

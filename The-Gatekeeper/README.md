# Can you speak the silent word?


The old terminal flickers. A prompt appears.  
A voice encoded in bytes asks for *the word*.

Those who answer wrong are erased.  
Those who answer right? Nobody remembers them anymore.

They say the answer is hidden in the code â€” buried, scrambled, waiting.  
Only those who see the unseen may pass.

`The dragon might show you the way`

This box is completed when you speak the word that opens the path to the flag.

Flag structure is: FLAG{test_string}
